    <h2>Contribution</h2>

    <p>
        My job for the APW website was to study Node, and then use my knowledge on it to assit on a Admin page and Authentication page. 
        Unfortunately, we did not get to much real coding, but my partner and I really did get a good sense of how packages work and how to 
        manage them with Node. With this knowledge of Node, I hopefully will be well prepared to use it in the future. It is a good set of skill 
        to have.
