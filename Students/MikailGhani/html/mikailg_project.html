    <h2>Project</h2>
    
    <p>

        I have a previous interest in chess, and I plan to delve into a deep study of tactics, stratagies and principles while 
        making an Engine like Stockfish or Alpha0 that machine learns. Along with the actual coding, I think it will be a good way to
        learn two things at once; both of which I am very interested in.
