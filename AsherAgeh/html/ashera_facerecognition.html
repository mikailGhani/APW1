			<h3>What is our goal?</h3>
			<p>This is a continuation of our project from last year in which we began to look into OpenCv and facial
			recognition. We wanted to create a program that would run continuously in the background and immediately
			turn off the computer as soon as it recognized an unknown face, however, we only got through the very
			basic steps of face recognition.<br> Moving forward, we plan to finish our project and have our script
			constantly checking to see if the person looking at the computer is the owner or not. If the user is
			unidentified, the computer will immediately turn off.</p>

		<h4>11/3/2021</h4>
		<p>Anna and I began looking into ways to allow python to shut down a Mac - or at least log out the user. This
		proved to be harder using Apple's OS as opposed to Windows. After a lot of researching we found two methods:
		one immediately shuts down the mac but only works through the terminal, and the other works through PyCharm and
		initiates a warning before actually shutting down the Mac. We would like to be able to connect the code we
		have written in PyCharm to the main terminal which we hope will immediately shut the computer down when
		prompted.</p>
		<br />
		<h4>11/10/2021</h4>
		<p>When trying to create an 'if statement' to turn the computer off, we noticed that the if statement wouldn't
		run until after the main function had been completed (the facial recognition was ended). To solve this issue we
		began working with threading to try and force both functions (face recognition and condition) to work simultaneously.
		When that didn't work we tried a simple "while True" loop which worked successfully.</p>
		<br />
		<h4>11/15/2021</h4>
		<p>This week we attempted to connect our work in PyCharm to the line of code that only worked in the terminal.
		We attempted to return the terminal code in our PyCharm script and then run the file within the terminal,
		however, this was unsuccessful. As we were wrapping up we had an idea to use the 'pyautogui' library to
		control the computers mouse which will automatically click the confirm button when the box pops up before the
		computer shuts down.</p>
		<br />
		<h4>11/18/2021</h4>
		<p>Today we used 'pyautogui' to find the position of the "shut down" button and click it. Our final outlying
		issue was that the program was still ineffective until somebody pressed quit. We are now in a very good position
		where the program runs in the background without showing the camera window in the foreground.</p>
