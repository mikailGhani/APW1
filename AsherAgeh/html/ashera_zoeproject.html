<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>I created the Zoom Operation Expert (Z.O.E) during the Covid-19 pandemic. I found it somewhat tedious searching
for zoom links to different classes for 9 hours a day, so I created a program which would automatically sign me into
classes on time.</p>
<br />
<h2>Creation</h2>
<p>I had a few ideas on what the best way to create this program was; I knew that I needed to give the program
access to my calendar. I ended up inputting my full schedule into a CSV file which the program would read (this took a
while with a 10-day schedule). Within the main class of the program I created variable names for each item in the CSV
file that leads to the corresponding zoom link.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<h3>Interaction</h3>
<p>There were two main bases of interaction with this program: text based and speech based.</p>
<p>When the program first starts, the user is prompted to input which day's schedule is required. After this is
supplied the program will sign in to classes on time throughout the day and quit once the day is over.</p>
<p>The speech based interaction uses the computer's microphone to listen to a set of specific requests: "Mute mic",
"Un mute mic", "Tun on video", "Turn off video", and "End call".</p>
<h3>Extra Feature</h3>
<p>Finally, I noticed that sometimes I was being sent zoom links within emails when teachers were trying to set up meetings.
I used my knowledge with reading emails, "regex", and "natural language processing" to read emails, filter out any unnecessary text,
and extract a zoom link and a time. This process signs in to the meeting at the given time.</p>
