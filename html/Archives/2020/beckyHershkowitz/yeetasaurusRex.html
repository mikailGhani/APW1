<h1>What I Did:</h1>
<p>I created an array of working clocks which display the time in various major cities around the world. Each clock was designed by me using java graphics.</p>

<h1>What I Learned:</h1>
<p>I learned how to program basic animations in javascript, including how to make a method repeat after a certain interval, to create a moving a drawing.</p>

<h1>What Next?</h1>
<p>My next project will be a return to my physics engine that I began work on next year. I want to finish the graphics and add interactable items</p>
