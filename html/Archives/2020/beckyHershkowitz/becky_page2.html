<p>2019-2020: This year, Danny and I are going to program a food log that will be used to keep track of everything we eat with a simple submission form. We want to make the program advanced enough to be able to show trends, search, filter by date, database of known foods, and calorie count. We are going to use Adam in order to edit in real time on both of our computers. <p>

	2018-2019:
	A. For my contribution to the class website, I made my own page modeled on Golanka's original code. On the page, I included a header along with a list that includes a link to google and a button that makes text appear. Additionally, I added an image of an elephant. I made a button that allows you to change the image when you click it. When you click on the button, it changes the image from an elephant to a turtle, then to Mickey Mouse, then to a girafe, then back to the elephant and so on. I also played with the graphics of the website. When I started this project, I had never heard of Github or Sublime and by the end I learned how to add buttons, images, links, and more. I now understand the basics of how to use Github and Sublime and actually find it quite fun to code by own website. </p>
 <p>	B. For my nect project, I would like to expand my knowledge on Github, as well as Sublime. I would like to keep adding to my website, however make it much more intricate and with a more specific and clear purpose. I have not decided specifically what I want to do yet but something along those lines.  </p>
